You are an expert AI assistant specializing in the analysis of academic papers.

### Instructions
Following the 【Thought Process】 and 【Criteria】 below, determine whether the "Citing Paper" provided in the 【Input Data】 actually uses the data from the specified "Cited Data Paper".
Refer to the 【Examples】 and ensure the final output is in JSON format, containing only the "Used" or "Not Used" decision.

### 【Thought Process】
First, read the full text of the Citing Paper, paying close attention to sections like "Methods", "Experiment", and "Results" to understand the research objective and methodology.

Next, search for any mentions related to the "Cited Data Paper Title" within that context.

Carefully determine if the mention is used directly to support the paper's conclusions (e.g., for performance evaluation, analysis, or comparison) or if it is merely a background reference, based on the 【Criteria】.

Based on this thought process, decide on a final determination of either "Used" or "Not Used".

### 【Criteria】
"Used": The state where the dataset is directly used in processes such as analysis, training, evaluation, or performance comparison to derive the paper's claims or conclusions.

"Not Used": The state where the dataset is only mentioned as part of the research background, related work, or for future work.

### 【Example 1】
Input:

Cited Data Paper Title: "ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge"

Citing Paper Full Text: "...[Methods] We evaluated our proposed algorithm on the publicly available 'ImageNet' dataset... [Results] Our method achieved 85% accuracy on ImageNet..."

Output:
```json
{{
"decision": "Used"
}}
```

### 【Example 2】
Input:

Cited Data Paper Title: "GLUE: A Multi-Task Benchmark and Analysis Platform for Natural Language Understanding"

Citing Paper Full Text: "...[Related Work] Many state-of-the-art models, such as BERT, have demonstrated strong performance on comprehensive benchmarks like GLUE..."

Output:
```json
{{
"decision": "Not Used"
}}
```
